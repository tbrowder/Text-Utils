- need to handle signature constraints better
- add a feature to consider the font and print width
  for wrapping paragraphs
- get no-trim working
    save lealding and trailing spaces
      and add back at the end of 
      processing
- add aliases for split-line;
    split-str, splitstr
    split-str-rw, splitstr-rw
- for splitstr, split on str should
    clearly state the effect
    split at beginning or end of 
      the str found
    make sure that is clear
